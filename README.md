Participated in the 2024 Huawei Sweden Hackathon in Nov, ranking 16th out of 30 teams.
Worked with a dataset of over 20,000 samples, split into 20 slices, to develop predictive modelsDesigned and trained GCNs and using Python and TensorFlow to capture spatiarelationships.
Applied data augmentation, resampling, andhyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.
Successfully optimized the model, reducing the prediction error score from 170 to 124.
